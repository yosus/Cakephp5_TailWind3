<br /><br />
## Step 1 : Install Cakephp5

This step is not covered here, as you are expected to be familiar with Cakephp framework. Follow the instructions here : [Cakephp 5 installation](https://book.cakephp.org/5/en/installation.html)

<br /><br />

## Step 2 : Install TailWind

See official tailwind installation site at [TailWind](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/installation). As of writing, the Tailwind version is 3.4.13. 
Go to your Cakephp5 root folder (where composer.json file is). There are mainly these 2 installation-commands :

```bash
npm install -D tailwindcss
npx tailwindcss init
```

After TailWind installation, there will be additional 'node' folders and 'package' files in the Cakephp project folder.

<br /><br />

## Step 3 : Build TailWind Command

This is the command to build style.css **constantly** when template files are changed. Call this command at your Cakephp5 root folder (where composer.json file is)
```bash
npx tailwindcss -i  resources/input.css -o webroot/css/style.css --watch;
```

<br /><br />

## Other : Files To Note

Here are the few files to take note of :

1. tailwind.config.js (generated by TailWind during installation)
2. resources/input.css
3. webroot/css/style.css (generated by tailwind when calling `npx tailwindcss -i resources/input.css -o webroot/css/style.css `)
